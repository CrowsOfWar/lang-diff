Lang-Diff Readme
================

This is a simple tool to help translators know what new things to translate. It generates diffs between [language files](https://github.com/CrowsOfWar/AvatarMod/blob/master/src/main/resources/assets/avatarmod/lang/en_US.lang) by scanning for new commits via the GitHub API.

Installation
------------

Download the repo and run `app.py` from the command line. It requires dateutil which can be installed by running:

> pip install python-dateutil

Further options to run will be added in the future
